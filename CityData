Data will be created using City-Data.com. Using Beautiful Soup, I scrape their City home page sites gathering the name, population density,
median income level and continue to the neighborhood specific profile to get the zipcodes corresponding to that neighborhood.
The dataframe from that function is this:

ZipCodes	Neighborhood	PopulationDensity	MedianIncome
0	23222	Barton Heights	3,869	$35,508
1	23222	Barton Heights Cemeteries	4,174	$27,500
2	23222	Battery Park	4,856	$44,386
3	23220	Belle Isle	1,830	$34,103
4	23227	Bellevue	3,166	$45,852
5	23224	Blackwell	3,744	$39,309
6	23220	Boulevard	8,866	$52,260
6	23221	Boulevard	8,866	$52,260
7	23224	Broad Rock	2,222	$37,189
7	23234	Broad Rock	2,222	$37,189

Through python geocoding, latitude and longitude will be added as columns. 
This process is completed for city one and city 2. Population and Median Income will be put into categorical variables of 'Low','Medium',
'High'. Then in combination with the foursquare most common venues, the cluster will be created based on the tale above.
